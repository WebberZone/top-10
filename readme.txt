Track daily and total visits on your blog posts. Display the count as well as popular and trending posts.

== Description ==

WordPress doesn't have an in-built system to track page views or displaying popular posts. [Top 10](https://webberzone.com/plugins/top-10/) is an easy to use, yet, powerful WordPress plugin that will count the number of page views of your posts, pages and any custom post types. You can then display the page view counts as well as display your most popular posts.

Top 10 adds two widgets that you can use to display a list of popular posts and the counta cross all your blog posts.

Although several similar plugins exist today, Top 10 is one of the most feature-rich popular post plugins with support for thumbnails, shortcodes, widgets, custom post types and CSS styles. The inbuilt caching system also helps reduce server load by caching your popular posts output. The tracking uses ajax and is thus compatible with most popular caching plugins.

Top 10 also has powerful API and is fully extendable with WordPress actions and filters to allow you easily extend the code base to add new features or tweak existing ones.

= Features =

* **Page counter**: Counts page views on single posts, pages and *custom post types* on an hourly basis which can then be easily displayed automatically, using shortcodes or functions
* **Popular posts**: Display a list of popular posts either for total counts or for a custom period. You can choose how many posts are to be displayed along with loads of other customisation options
* **Gutenberg / Block Editor support**: You can find a block called "Popular Posts [Top 10]" with its own configurable set of options
* **Widget ready**: Sidebar widgets available for daily popular and overall popular posts. Highly customizable widgets to control what you want to display in the list of posts
* **Shortcodes**: The plugin includes two shortcodes `[tptn_list]` and `[tptn_views]` to display the posts list and the number of views respectively
* **Thumbnail support**

	* Auto-extract the first image in your post to be displayed as a thumbnail
	* Manually enter the URL of the thumbnail via [WordPress meta fields](http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields). Specify this using the meta box in your Edit screens.
* **Exclusions**: Exclude posts from select categories from appearing in the top posts list. Also exclude posts by ID from appearing in the list
* **Styles**: The output is wrapped in CSS classes which allows you to easily style the list. You can enter your custom CSS styles from within WordPress Admin area or use the style included.
* **Admin interface**: View list of daily and/or overall popular posts from within the dashboard. Top 10 also adds two sortable columns to your All Posts and All Pages pages in your WordPress Admin area
* **Export/Import interface**: Export the count tables and settings to restore in the same site or on other installs
